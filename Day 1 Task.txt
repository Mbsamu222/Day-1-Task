1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

                            HTTP/1.1

                          HTTP/2

1. It works on the textual format.
1. It works on the binary protocol 
2. There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
2. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3. It uses requests resource for use getting multiple pages
3. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
4. It compresses data by itself.
4. It uses HPACK for data compression.
5. HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server
5. From a technical point of view, one of the most significant features that distinguishes HTTP/1.1
6. The first response that a client receives on an HTTP GET request is often not the fully rendered page
6. Stream prioritization not only solves the possible issue of requests competing for the same resource
7. In HTTP/1.1, flow control relies on the underlying TCP connection
7. HTTP/2 multiplexes streams of data within a single TCP connection.
8. In HTTP/1.1, if the developer knows in advance which additional resources the client machine will need to render
8. HTTP/2 enables multiple concurrent responses to a client’s initial GET , a server can send a resource to a client along with the requested HTML page
9. Programs like have long been used to compress the data sent in HTTP messages, especially to decrease the size of CSS and JavaScript files.
9. One of the themes that has come up again and again in HTTP/2 is its ability to use the binary framing layer to exhibit greater control over finer detail.
10.  	1	The client (browser) has to send a request to the server using the method (GET/POST).

10. HTTP/2 was released at Google as the significant improvement of its predecessor.
